vagrant-sharelatex
==================

::

  mkdir data

place your setttings.development.coffee in the data dir::

  edit data/setttings.development.coffee

vagrant up

Idieally this shoudl start up all of the services automatically and configure things correctly, however for some reason it does not work

On your local host you should be able to open the web browser on::

  http://localhost:3000


However it does not work :(

If you know how to fix this, please contact me.
